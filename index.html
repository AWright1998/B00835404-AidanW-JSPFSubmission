    <img src="assets/me.JPG" class="fakeimg">  
    <p>I'm Aidan Wright, a 25-year-old with a passion for bringing digital worlds to life. Currently immersed in the dynamic realm of game development, <br></br> I find joy in the creative fusion of technology and imagination.<br></br>

As a game development student, I am on a thrilling journey to master the intricacies of this ever-evolving industry. My days are filled with code, design, and the constant pursuit of refining my skills to craft immersive and captivating gaming experiences.
  From a young age, I've been fascinated by the limitless possibilities that games offer.<br></br> Whether it's the thrill of exploration, the strategic challenge, or the emotional narrative, games have the power to transport us to entirely new dimensions. Now, I'm dedicated to learning the ropes and contributing my own unique perspective to this vibrant community.
My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages, game design principles, and the ability to tackle complex challenges head-on. I thrive in collaborative environments, valuing the synergy that diverse minds bring to the creative process.</p>
